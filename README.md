# JavaDataStructures
All coded material from Java Data Structures class at NVCC (CSC202) are found in the 'src' folder.

All development was through the IntelliJ IDE.

Please excuse inefficiencies and atypical coding practices. This is my first time coding object orientation as well as the Java 
language (excluding my practice repository located here: https://github.com/davidkim827/Practice).

The following are the concepts I have learned over the weeks:

	Week 1: Review
	Week 2: Recursion
	Week 3: Stack (Array Implementation) ADT
	Week 4: Stack (Linked List Implementation) ADT
	Week 5: Queue ADT
	Week 6: Multi-Threading
	Week 7: Implementation of Queue & Multi-Threading
	Week 8: List ADT (Linked List Implementation)
	Week 9: Tree ADT (Binary Search)
	Week 10: Tree ADT (Binary Expression)
	Week 11: Priority Queue w/ Heap
	Week 12: Graph ADT (Digraph)

All work was directed under Dr. Xue Bai of NVCC. Thank you for the class!
