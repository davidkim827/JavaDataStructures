# JavaDataStructures
All coded material from Java Data Structures class at NVCC (CSC202).

Please excuse inefficiencies and atypical coding practices. This is my first time coding object orientation as well as the Java 
language (excluding my practice repository located here: https://github.com/davidkim827/Practice).

The following is the concepts I have learned over the weeks:

	Week 1: "Review"
	Week 2: Recursion
	Week 3: Stacks (array implementation)
	Week 4: Stacks (linked list implementation)
