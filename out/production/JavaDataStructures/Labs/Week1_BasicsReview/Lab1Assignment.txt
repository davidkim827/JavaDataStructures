Part 1 (5 points):
Design a program named Array2DPrint.java and implement the method specified below:

   public static void print(int[][] arr)

This method prints the elements in a N x N two dimensional integer array as shown below:
-------------
| X | O |   |
-------------
| O |   | X |
-------------
|   | X | O |
-------------

If the value of an element is 1, place a symbol X in its corresponding location, and O for a value of 0. For all other values, place an empty space in its location. For example, in the above sample run, the value of the element in [0][0] is 1, so X is displayed on [0][0] location. 

Then test your program as follows (int the main method):
1. Define a 3 x 3 integer array
2. Randomly assign numbers between 0 and 3, inclusive, to the elements of the array
3. Call print method


Part 2 (5 points):
Design a java program named WordCount.java to count the occurrence of a particular word in a file. Both file and the word are passed as arguments to the main method.

data file: wordCount.txt

Sample output:

The word "java" appears 7 timed in in the file.

Part 3: (10 points)
Design a java program named GradeCount.java to read data from a gradebook (gradebook.txt contains grades only) and count how many students are in each of the following categories:
90 - 100
80 - 89
70 - 79
60 - 69
Below 60

And printout the number of students in each category.

Here is sample output:

Category      No. of Students
[90 - 100]         5
[80 - 89]          10
[70 - 79]          4
[60 - 69]          2
[<60]              1

Here is the sample data file:

82 100 88 90 56 76 67 60 2000
98 65 90 85 67 81 93 86 88B
87 70 88 78 84 76 81 89
