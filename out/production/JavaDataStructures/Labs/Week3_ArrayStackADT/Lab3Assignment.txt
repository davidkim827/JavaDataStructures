Using array to implement a Stack ADT that keeps track of items in the bag and the total cost


Requirements

Create a class called Item with the following data members: itemName (String), quantity  (int, the number of the item) and retailPrice (float, unit price). As well as getter and setter methods.

An interface ShoppingBagInterface with the following abstract methods are provided:
    void push(Item item); 
    void pop();// delete top item
    Item top();// get the top item
    boolean isFull(); 
    boolean isEmpty();

Create a class called ShoppingBag to implement ShoppingBagInterface. Objects of this class represent a single shopping bag. Attributes of such an object include  an array to store items (objects of the Item class) in the bag and a tax rate, and any other members that are required to implement the selected ADT, in this case, it is an array. Provide a constructor that accepts a tax rate as a float parameter and capacity of the bag as an int parameter.

Create an application that reads data from a data file. The first line contains the tax rate and the capacity of the shopping bag. Each of the rest lines in the data file represents an item: item name, quantity, and retail price. For example, AAA Battery  5  0.99, represents 5 AAA Batteries that cost $0.99 each. Read all items in the data file if the shopping bag is not full. Then display a summary of the status of the shopping bag.



Sample data file:
0.05   5
Colored Pencils 		3	0.59
Notebook	5	0.99
AAA Battery  5  0.99

Output of the program

The bag contains:
------------------------------------------------
Name of the Items 	Quantity	Subtotal
Colored Pencils		     3		   $1.77
Notebook		     5		   $4.95
AAA Battery  		     5		   $4.95
------------------------------------------------
			 Total:	          $11.67
		      Tax (5%):            $0.58
------------------------------------------------
                   Grand Total:           $12.25
