We developed the NumberQueue ADT in class. We assume each number in the queue represent a person in the line waiting for being served at your restaurant.
Based on historical data, you found that on average, one customer arrives at your restaurant on every five minutes interval, 
and it takes 3 minutes to serve each customer. Write a tester program to simulate the queue for 8 hours, then print the longest 
queue size during the 8 hours operation. Did anyone leave your restaurant because the line if full? (assume the maximum capacity 
of the line is 10 people)
