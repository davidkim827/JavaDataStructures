This is similar to the first version of the simulation lab. However, you are required to track the average waiting time for all customers, 
and the longest waiting time among them. To do so, you need to redesign the queue because you need more fields to store customer information,
for example, you may need to track their arriving time and when they are served. All other information reamins the same as previous assignment:
on average, one customer arrives at your restaurant on every five minutes interval, and it takes 3 minutes to serve each customer. 

Write a tester program to simulate the queue for 8 hours, then print the longest queue size during the 8 hours operation, total customer arrives, 
average waiting time, and longest waiting time. Did anyone leave your restaurant because the line if full? (assume the maximum capacity of the line is 10 people)
