	
Write a GUI based program to help users to analyze a text string. The user will type a text in a text filed. Your program will help the user to determine:
1. The length of the text
2. The number of vowels in the text
3. The number of uppercase letters in the text
4. The mode of letters in the text(the most occurrences of the character)
5. Count the number of Latin alphabetic letters

For this assignment, you should design and code a separate (non-GUI) class encapsulating a text and its analysis, then instantiate an object of that class inside your GUI application and call the various class as needed. To do so, you need to create a class named TextAnalyzer.java that exdends TextAnalyzerAnstract class. Here is the summary of tasks for this assignment:

1. Create a class named TextAnalyzer.java that extends TextAnalyzerAbstract.
2. Create a GUI application named GUITextAnalyser.java

A demo program is provided. Please run the GUITextAnalyzerDemo.class to see how it looks like and operates.
