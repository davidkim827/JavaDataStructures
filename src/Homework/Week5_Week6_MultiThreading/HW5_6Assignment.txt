Problem 1:
Create a PrintChar class that implements Runnable. The constructor should accept a character and an integer as parameters. 
The run method should print the character the number of times indicated by the integer. Create an application named CharApp.java 
that instantiates two PrintChar objecs, one passed "A" and 200 and the other one passed "B" and 200. It them instantiates and starts two thread objects. 
Experiment with the resulting system, using different numerical parameters for PrintChar objects. Create a report (a text file printChar.txt) about the 
results of your experiments.

Problem 2:
Create an application named MaxRowSum.java that instantiates a 20x20 two-dimentional array of integers, populates it with random integers drawn from the 
range 1 to 100, and then output the index of the row with the highest sum along all the rows. To support your solution, create a class named RowSumThread.java 
from which you can instantiate Runnable objects, each of which will sum one row of the two-dimensional array and then place the sum of that row into the 
appropriate slot of a one-dimensional, 20-element array. 

To Summarize, your application will:

1. Generate the two-dimensional array of random integers
2. Start 20 concurrent threads, each of which places the sum of one row of the two-dimensional array into the corresponding slot of a one-dimensional array.
3. Onput the index of the row with the maximum value.
