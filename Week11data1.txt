If we ever want to know how background job works, fastest way to find k smallest elements in an array, how merging tables in database works behind the scenes, keep reading. Because in this article, we will discuss about priority queues and disjoint set. Both data structures are beautiful to solve these problems. In the end, we will solve these problems above. Happy reading Priority Queue is a Queue where each element is assigned a priority and elements com out in order by priority. Typical use case of priority queue is scheduling jobs. Each job has a priority and we process jobs in order of decreasing priority. While the current job is processed and new jobs may arrive. binary heap has 2 types: binary min heap and binary max heap. In this article, we will discuss about binary max heap. On the other side, binary min heap has the same way of implementation.
Binary max-heap is a binary tree, each node has zero, one or two children, where the value of each node is at least the values of its children.Root node R is the max value of max-heap. To pop out the root node, we just swap root node R to any leaf node A and remove node R. It may violate the property of heap. We will do SiftDown operation. As a parent node A, we want to SiftDown to children B and C, we will choose the max value of children B and C, and swap it to node A. We SiftDown until the property of heap is satisfied.
